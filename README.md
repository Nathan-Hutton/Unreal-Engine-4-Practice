# Unreal-Engine-4-Practice
Various scripts for Unreal Engine 4 meant to open an in game door when an object is in the trigger space, and script meant to pickup objects. Works in both first and third person.

I have not been able to test these files since the launch of Unreal Engine 5, but I believe that the files with "test" at the end are meant for the third person game whereas everything else is meant for a first person game.
